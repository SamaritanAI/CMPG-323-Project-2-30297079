# CRUD RESTful API Readme
## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific functions and actions that the CRUD RESTful API must perform. These requirements guide the behavior and capabilities of the API. In this project, you are expected to implement the following functions:

1. **Create**: Allow users to create new items by sending POST requests with the necessary data.
2. **Read**: Enable users to retrieve item details using GET requests with appropriate parameters.
3. **Update**: Provide the capability to update item information using PUT or PATCH requests.
4. **Delete**: Allow users to remove items from the system using DELETE requests.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements focus on the quality attributes of the system. These attributes ensure that the functional requirements are implemented effectively and adhere to good software practices. The non-functional requirements for this project include:

1. **Performance**: The API should respond to requests promptly, with minimal latency, even when handling a large number of concurrent users.
2. **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle increased load by scaling horizontally or vertically.
3. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate data.
4. **Reliability**: The API should be robust and resilient, with proper error handling and graceful degradation in case of failures.
5. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for the API, including endpoints, request/response formats, and examples.
6. **Testing**: Implement thorough unit testing, integration testing, and possibly end-to-end testing to ensure the API's correctness and reliability.
7. **Maintainability**: Write clean and well-structured code, follow coding standards, and use version control effectively.



Please look forward to it. :)
